# SD logs

Logs are files in which all the data from connected sensors is stored. Each line of a log file contains three parts:

- Date and time,
- Name of the parameter,
- Measured value.
  
This is an example of a log item:

`2000-01-01 00:00:06.757    ENGINETEMP  54`

As you can see, the three parts are divided by tabulation characters (`\t`). The general structure of a log item is:

`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.ttt    XXXXXXXXXX  VAL`

Every part except the value (`VAL`) has fixed length.
Date and time are divided by a single space character.
